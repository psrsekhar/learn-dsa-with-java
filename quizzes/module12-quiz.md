## Quiz

1. What is a trie used for?
   - A) Storing strings in a space-efficient manner
   - B) Searching for words
   - C) Both A and B

2. In Dijkstra's algorithm, what is the main strategy?
   - A) To find the shortest path in a graph
   - B) To sort the graph
   - C) To minimize the number of edges

3. What is the Hamming Distance?
   - A) The number of positions at which two strings of equal length differ
   - B) The number of common characters between two strings
   - C) The sum of characters in two strings

4. What is the time complexity of inserting a string into a trie?
   - A) O(n)
   - B) O(m)
   - C) O(n * m), where n is the number of strings and m is the length of the longest string

5. How do you calculate the cheapest flights within K stops?
   - A) By using dynamic programming
   - B) By using breadth-first search (BFS)
   - C) By using depth-first search (DFS)
