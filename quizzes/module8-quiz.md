# Module 8: Greedy Algorithms

In this module, we will explore greedy strategies to solve optimization problems. You will learn how to approach problems where local optimal solutions lead to a global optimal solution.

## Topics Covered
- Greedy strategies
- Maximizing and minimizing problems

## Key Problems
- Maximum 69 Number
- Max Units on a Truck
- Reduce Array Size to Half

## Quiz

1. What is the main idea behind greedy algorithms?
   - A) Choose the best solution at each step
   - B) Explore all possible solutions
   - C) Use dynamic programming to find the best solution

2. In the problem of maximizing units on a truck, what should you consider first?
   - A) The weight of the items
   - B) The value-to-weight ratio of the items
   - C) The total weight capacity of the truck

3. What is the result of reducing the array size [1, 2, 3, 4] to half using greedy strategy?
   - A) [1, 2]
   - B) [3, 4]
   - C) Both A and B

4. What is the time complexity of the Maximum 69 Number problem?
   - A) O(n)
   - B) O(log n)
   - C) O(n^2)

5. What is a characteristic of greedy algorithms?
   - A) They always produce optimal solutions
