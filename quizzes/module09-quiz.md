# Module 9: Binary Search

In this module, we will delve into binary search algorithms. You will learn how to implement binary search on sorted arrays and in various solution spaces.

## Topics Covered
- Binary search on arrays
- Search in solution spaces

## Key Problems
- Search Insert Position
- Find Smallest Divisor
- Split Array Largest Sum

## Quiz

1. What is the average time complexity of binary search?
   - A) O(n)
   - B) O(log n)
   - C) O(n log n)

2. In binary search, what is the condition to continue the search?
   - A) The array is sorted
   - B) The target value is found
   - C) The mid-point is greater than the target

3. When would you use binary search on a solution space?
   - A) When the array is unsorted
   - B) When the problem has a sorted characteristic
   - C) Both A and B

4. If a sorted array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], what is the result of searching for 3?
   - A) Index 2
   - B) Index 3
   - C) Not found

5. How do you split an array into two parts with the largest sum in binary search?
   - A) By iterating through the entire array
   - B) By using a binary search on possible sums
   - C) By applying dynamic programming
