# Module 7: Heaps

In this module, we will cover heap operations, priority queues, and top K problems. You will learn how to implement and utilize heaps to solve various problems.

## Topics Covered
- Heap operations
- Priority queues
- Top K problems

## Key Problems
- Kth Largest Element in Array
- K Closest Points to Origin
- Min Cost to Connect Sticks

## Quiz
