In this module, we will learn about dynamic programming techniques to solve optimization problems. We will explore 1D, multidimensional, and matrix DP.

## Topics Covered
- 1D DP
- Multidimensional DP
- Matrix DP

## Key Problems
- Climbing Stairs
- Coin Change
- Unique Paths II

## Quiz

1. What is dynamic programming primarily used for?
   - A) To divide problems into subproblems
   - B) To find optimal solutions by storing results of subproblems
   - C) Both A and B

2. What is the time complexity of the Coin Change problem?
   - A) O(n)
   - B) O(n * amount)
   - C) O(amount)

3. In the Climbing Stairs problem, what is the base case?
   - A) 0 stairs
   - B) 1 stair
   - C) 2 stairs

4. How does memoization help in dynamic programming?
   - A) By reducing space complexity
   - B) By storing previously computed results
   - C) By increasing time complexity

5. In Unique Paths II, how do obstacles affect the path count?
   - A) They have no effect
   - B) They reduce the count by half
   - C) They block certain paths
